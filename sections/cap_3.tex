\chapter{Problem and State of the Art}

\section{Problem}

The Lightning Network protocol as described in \ref{sec:lightning_network} is 
driven by a consensius between group of implementors in order to standardize
a feature. Where most of the time in order to adress a well known problem a data 
driven analysis on a groupd of nodes it is required in order to emphasize the
problem and sometimes also to see the real impact of the solution after be 
implemented but before begin a standard.
However, in order to perform a data driven analysis in an ecosystem where the decision
is drive by a kind of consensius, it is required also to some kind of 
constraint on how this data driven analysis is perform and analyzed across 
different implementations.

\subsection{Data Drive Analysis on the Lightning Network}

Currently the most common data driven analysis on the Lightning Network is performed 
on gossip data that any node can with at least one public channel can 
have access to. An example of this kind analysis is descrived in \cite{lngossip}
where the data are collected from core lightning and archived.

However, at the current state of the art there is no example on how to perform
an data driven analysis on local data collected across implementations to 
analyze the current daily behaivord of a node in a real envoirment, but there
are a notorius number of reseach that can receive more attention if was 
descrived with a data analysis on real nodes such as \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2103-08576} 
and \cite{cryptoeprint:2022/1454}.


\subsection{Local Data Driven Analysis}

Today perform a data driven analysis on local data that are considered private
is difficult because there is no real data available where to perform simulation
other that the one provided by reseach tool such as \cite{lngossip}.
Therefore, this lack of data can slow down the reseach process or limit the 
reseach scope because currently the reseacher that are not Lightning Network
developer have no access to local data because it is required to run a 
Lightning Node with real bitcoin involved, or perform the analysis on a 
testnet Network that it is not reliable like the real one as described in 
\ref{sec:solution}. 
Another problem caused by this lack of data is that the reseach propose till now
are pure teoretycally and in this way the implementors are required to deep 
understanding the problem (and this is not always possible) and move the 
assumtion to implementation specific values, and most of the time this required
another data driven analysis.
