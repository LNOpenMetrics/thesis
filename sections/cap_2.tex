\chapter{Bitcoin}

\section{Introduction}

The Bitcoin network is a decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency system
that allows users to send and receive payments without the need for a
central authority. It is powered by a distributed ledger technology called the blockchain, which records and verifies all transactions on the network.
Bitcoin is the first and most widely used cryptocurrency announced in the 2009
in a white paper \cite{nakamoto2009bitcoin}\footnote{The author of the paper act as
  Satoshi Nakamoto, and he disappear in the Bitcoin ecosystem after a while.}.

The innovative idea proposed by Bitcoin was not a virtual currency that can be
exchange on internet, but Bitcoin solves the problem of authority inside this kind
of system, through a proof of work protocol previously described in a system called HashCash\cite{back2002hashcash}\footnote{HashCash was an early form of digital currency that was developed in 1997. It was designed to be used as a form of payment for email services, but it never gained widespread adoption. Unlike Bitcoin, HashCash was not decentralized and relied on a centralized system, making it vulnerable to fraud and manipulation.}

- How the process of publish a new transactions happens
- How the transactions is a immutable concept and how the change transaction happens

\section{Bitcoin Script}

\subsection{Bitcoin Script Basics}

- Bitcoin Script basics, introduce how the bitcoin scrips works, and how may
kind of scripts exists
- Introduce the Bitcoin no standard
- Make a small zoom of what happens with the Bitcoin Script inside the example

\subsection{HTLC: Hash Time Locked Contract}
\label{sec:htlc_intro}

- Explain how the Transaction with a not standard script are used in lightning;
- Explain how the Transaction are replaced and managed in lightning at bitcoin level;
- Tell about bitcoin script and the segregated witness update;
- Use the example before but with lightning, and highlight the benefit and the downside.
