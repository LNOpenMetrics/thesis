  The Lightning Network is a proposed off-chain solution to Bitcoin scalability
  problems that enables peers to exchange partially signed transactions without violating
  Bitcoin rules. Despite its potential, Bitcoin still needs to be made more scalable to
  compete with modern payment systems. One approach is to make changes to the protocol,
  but implementing these changes to the Lightning Network can take time and evaluation
  of different proposals. This thesis aims to address the lack of public data on real
  Lightning Network nodes. We develop a collection of tools to be used in nodes
  with daily activity. We also define and collect Lightning Network metrics to
  better understand node performance. The proposed open-source framework for
  defining and collecting these metrics enables people with varied degrees of expertise 
  to conduct small-scale research for the Lightning Network.
