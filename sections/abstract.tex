  The Lightning Network is a proposed off-chain solution to Bitcoin's scalability
  problems that enables peers to exchange partially signed transactions without violating
  Bitcoin rules. Despite its potential, Bitcoin still needs to be made more scalable to
  compete with modern payment systems. One approach is to make changes to the protocol
  itself, but implementing these changes to the Lightning Network can take time and evaluation
  of different proposals. This thesis aims to address the lack of public data on real
  Lightning Network nodes by developing a collection of tools to be use in nodes
  with daily activity and defining and collecting Lightning Network metrics to
  better understand node performance. The proposed open-source framework for
  defining and collecting these metrics enables anyone to conduct small
  research for the Lightning Network with lower resource consumption
  and without a high level of expertise.
